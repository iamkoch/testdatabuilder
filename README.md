Test Data Builder
===============

- Sick of creating the same POJO over and over again?
- Sick of giving your test customer the same name, over and over again?

Look no further!

This project allows you to create a builder for each domain entity, pre-populating it with data so that you don't have to fill in data you don't even require for your unit tests.
